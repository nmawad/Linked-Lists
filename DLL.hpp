    //order. It then prints out the list both forwards and backwards. Your main should
    //call this constructor with a random number between 10 and 20, and that will pretty
    //much test most of the methods. For testing purposes, you can print out the list
    //forwards and backwards after inserting each new number to make sure everything is
